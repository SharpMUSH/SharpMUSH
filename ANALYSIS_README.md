This directory contains the results of a comprehensive inconsistency analysis of SharpMUSH commands and functions performed on October 30, 2025.

## Quick Navigation

### üöÄ Just Starting? Read This First
**[ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md](ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md)** - Executive summary with key findings and next steps (5KB)

### üìä Want the Full Details?
**[INCONSISTENCY_ANALYSIS.md](INCONSISTENCY_ANALYSIS.md)** - Complete analysis with methodology and strategy (12KB)

### üéØ Ready to Implement?
**[IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md)** - Prioritized list of what to build (6.4KB)

## What This Analysis Found

- **171 Commands** analyzed (55 implemented, 116 missing)
- **516 Functions** analyzed (302 implemented, 214 missing)
- **557 Total Issues** identified across three priority levels

## Top Critical Gaps

1. **Building System** - Cannot create objects, rooms, or exits
2. **Administrative Tools** - Cannot manage players or database
3. **Attribute System** - Limited attribute manipulation
4. **Channel System** - Most channel functionality missing
5. **Connection Management** - Cannot track player sessions

## For Different Audiences

### Project Maintainers
1. Start with **ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** for the big picture
2. Review **INCONSISTENCY_ANALYSIS.md** for complete details
3. Use **IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md** to plan work assignments
4. Create GitHub issues for high-priority items
5. Establish testing/documentation standards

### Contributors/Developers
1. Read **ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** to understand the landscape
2. Check **IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md** for what to implement
3. Pick an item from Layer 1 (Foundation) to start
4. Follow TDD: Write tests first, then implement
5. Add documentation to help files

### Users/Testers
1. Read **ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** to understand current limitations
2. Understand that 32% of commands and 58% of functions work
3. Critical features like object creation are not yet available
4. Set expectations based on implementation timeline

## Implementation Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2:** Foundation layer (loc, owner, parent functions)
- **Weeks 3-4:** Core building (@CREATE, @SET commands)
- **Weeks 5-6:** Building system (@DIG, @OPEN, @LINK)
- **Weeks 7-8:** Advanced building (@DESTROY, @CHOWN, @TELEPORT)
- **Months 2-6:** Administration, channels, utilities

## Key Principles

‚úÖ **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests before implementing
‚úÖ **PennMUSH Compatibility** - Match PennMUSH behavior where possible
‚úÖ **Documentation Required** - Every feature needs help text
‚úÖ **Layered Approach** - Build foundation before advanced features
‚úÖ **Code Review** - All changes reviewed before merging

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This was analysis only** - No implementations were made
‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not implement without tests** - TDD is required
‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not skip documentation** - Help text is mandatory
‚ö†Ô∏è **Check for existing PRs** - Coordinate with other contributors

## File Sizes

- ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md: ~5KB (quick read, 5 minutes)
- IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES.md: ~6KB (quick reference)
- INCONSISTENCY_ANALYSIS.md: ~12KB (comprehensive, 15-20 minutes)

## How to Use This Analysis

1. **For Planning:** Use statistics to estimate work effort
2. **For Prioritization:** Use critical gaps to focus resources
3. **For Development:** Use priorities to pick next tasks
4. **For Testing:** Use lists to ensure coverage
5. **For Documentation:** Use gaps to identify doc needs
