Test creates two rooms with @dig
Then tries to zone room1 to zmr with @chzone
On original code: works
On my code: zone is not set

Possible issues:
1. SafeToAddZone returning false when it shouldn't
2. Permission check failing
3. SetObjectZoneCommand not executing

Need to trace through the execution
