# ⚠️ Issue Creation Required - Manual Action Needed

## Current Status

The analysis of SharpMUSH has been **completed successfully**. However, creating the GitHub issues requires manual action due to environment limitations.

## What Has Been Done ✅

1. ✅ Analyzed entire codebase for unimplemented features
2. ✅ Identified 224 unimplemented items (107 commands, 117 functions)
3. ✅ Categorized all items into 14 functional categories
4. ✅ Created 15 detailed issue templates with:
   - Complete checklists
   - Testing requirements (with unique test strings)
   - Implementation guidelines
   - PennMUSH compatibility notes
5. ✅ Generated multiple tools for issue creation

## What Needs To Be Done ⏳

**15 GitHub issues need to be created and assigned to @copilot**

### Quick Start - Choose One Method:

#### Method 1: Using gh CLI (Fastest)
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/SharpMUSH/SharpMUSH
gh auth login
bash /tmp/create_github_issues.sh
```

#### Method 2: Using Python + GitHub API
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_personal_access_token'
python3 /tmp/create_issues_api.py
```

#### Method 3: Using GitHub Web UI (Manual)
1. Open `UNIMPLEMENTED_ANALYSIS.md`
2. For each of the 15 issue sections:
   - Go to https://github.com/SharpMUSH/SharpMUSH/issues/new
   - Copy the title
   - Copy the body content
   - Add labels: `enhancement`, `commands`/`functions`, category
   - Assign to: `@copilot`
   - Click "Submit new issue"

## The 15 Issues to Create

### Command Issues (7)
1. **Implement Attributes Commands** (5 items) - `@ATRCHOWN`, `@ATRLOCK`, `@CPATTR`, `@MVATTR`, `@WIPE`
2. **Implement Building/Creation Commands** (13 items) - `@CHOWN`, `@CLONE`, `@DESTROY`, etc.
3. **Implement Communication Commands** (5 items) - `@CLIST`, `ADDCOM`, etc.
4. **Implement Database Management Commands** (2 items) - `@MAPSQL`, `@SQL`
5. **Implement General Commands** (21 items) - `@ATTRIBUTE`, `@COMMAND`, `@EDIT`, etc.
6. **Implement HTTP Commands** (1 item) - `@RESPOND`
7. **Implement Other Commands** (60 items) - Various admin/gameplay commands

### Function Issues (8)
8. **Implement Attributes Functions** (12 items) - `grep()`, `wildgrep()`, `zfun()`, etc.
9. **Implement Connection Management Functions** (4 items) - `addrlog()`, `connlog()`, etc.
10. **Implement Database/SQL Functions** (3 items) - `sql()`, `mapsql()`, `sqlescape()`
11. **Implement HTML Functions** (6 items) - `html()`, `tag()`, `tagwrap()`, etc.
12. **Implement JSON Functions** (3 items) - `json_map()`, `oob()`, `isjson()`
13. **Implement Math & Encoding Functions** (13 items) - `encode64()`, `decrypt()`, vectors, etc.
14. **Implement Object Information Functions** (39 items) - `lock()`, `lsearch()`, `quota()`, etc.
15. **Implement Utility Functions** (37 items) - `functions()`, `rand()`, `registers()`, etc.

## Why Manual Action is Required

The automated agent environment has the following limitations:
- ❌ Cannot use `gh` commands to create issues (no GitHub credentials)
- ❌ Cannot call GitHub REST API directly (no authentication token)
- ❌ Cannot open new issues via any available tool

However, all the preparation work has been done to make creation as easy as possible!

## Files Available for Issue Creation

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **UNIMPLEMENTED_ANALYSIS.md** | Repository root | Complete issue content (21KB) |
| **ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md** | Repository root | Quick reference (5KB) |
| **ISSUE_CREATION_GUIDE.md** | Repository root | Step-by-step guide (4KB) |
| **create_github_issues.sh** | `/tmp/` | gh CLI automation script |
| **create_issues_api.py** | `/tmp/` | Python REST API script |
| **github_issues_to_create.json** | `/tmp/` | Structured JSON data |

## After Issue Creation

Once the 15 issues are created and assigned to @copilot:

1. ✅ Issues will serve as tracking for implementation progress
2. ✅ Each issue has a checklist that can be updated as items are completed
3. ✅ Labels allow filtering by category (commands/functions, category name)
4. ✅ All issues include comprehensive testing requirements
5. ✅ Implementation can proceed systematically by category

## Verification

After running the issue creation:
```bash
# Verify all issues were created
gh issue list --repo SharpMUSH/SharpMUSH --label enhancement --assignee copilot

# Should show 15 new issues
```
