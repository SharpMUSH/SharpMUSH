# Attribution
## PennMUSH
This Server is written in C# with a compatibility layer to the original PennMUSH server. 
As such, it is important to credit the original code of the server, and its long legacy. 
Attribution is not present in each code file at this time, but it cannot be overstated how imporant the original code is for writing the compatibility layer. 

On the short term, we will link to https://github.com/pennmush/pennmush/blob/master/COPYRITE, which gives a good history of the original PennMUSH codebase.
